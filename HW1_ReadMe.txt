	'Sort Me.txt' = The original text file that holds the list of names
	HW1.py = The python file that will sort the names of 'Sort Me.txt' and print out the result

How to Run:
	Make sure HW1.py and 'Sort Me.txt' are in the same folder
	Open a terminal/cmd in that same folder
	Use the command "python3 HW1.py" to run the python file
	The result should then print in the terminal
	
Possible Issues:
	You could have to use a different python initiator
		other examples are: py, python2, python
		If others do not work, finding you python executable path, and then naming HW1.py should work
		Also, make sure python is installed on your machine
